            <h2>But what exactly is this?</h2>
            <p> Recursion. Sequence. Ring a bell?   </p>

            <p>
                They are all hard to grasp by reading the pages of a book or listening to a lecturer's words. Videos might help you to understand it, but not everybody has that kind of time. How do we know? Well, we were once there.
            </p>

            <p> Once there? Are you guys no longer Computer Science students? </p>

            <p>
                We are still computer science students. Yes, we were once there. We are no longer there.
            </p>

            <p> 
                We learnt that the best way to learn hard concpets is by coding them out and we tried it.
            </p>

            <p> It worked. For us.  </p>

            <p> So, why not tell the whole world?   </p>

            <p> That is the reason you are here. </p>

            <p> This project is our way of telling the world what we have learnt.   </p>

            <p> What does it contain?   </p>

            <p> Everything. That is the short answer.   </p>

            <p> The long answer is: </p>
            <div>
                <li> It contains well documented solutions to  coding problems.  </li>
                
                <li>
                    It also contains code samples that shows you how each concept in real world situations
                </li>
            </div>

            <p>
                In the end, any student who goes through this project is bound to ace computer science. And be a better programmer.

                    There is something lower than bytes. It is called bits. And I am SteloyBits. I am currently learning data science to transform large data into consumable bits. I write problem solving code with Python and R.
